# Crypto Rewards
If you would like to experiment with crypto rewards for training, 
then run `cp .env.example .env` and populate the variables with
appropriate values. You also need to set `CRYPTO_REWARDS=true`
at the top of the file and fund your wallet with enough tokens
to stake. Please contact Prime Intellect for additional details.

This code is intended to be illustrative of a python integration
with the Solidity smart contracts included in this repository.
